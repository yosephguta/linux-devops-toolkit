## Day 1: SSH and Linux Filesystem

- Connected to AWS EC2 Ubuntu server using SSH
- Explored filesystem structure
- Identified key directories:
    - /etc (configuration)
    - /var (logs and runtime data)
    - /home (user directories)
    - ls -la (everything in the folder including hidden files and permissinos)
    - cd / (puts you in the root and not"root user")
- Learned about hidden files and how to secure keys
